# To-do-list
A to-do list is a written or digital list of tasks and activities that an individual plans to accomplish, typically organized by priority or deadline. It helps manage time, track progress, and increase productivity. Tasks can be categorized (e.g., work, personal, urgent), checked off when completed, and updated regularly.
